# Hurricanes-Analysis-Project

This CodeAcademy project organizes and manipulates data on Category 5 hurricanes, the most powerful hurricanes by wind speed.
The planned thing happened as follows: 

- Initially, the damage list was updated to convert the prefix values to floating point numbers and "Damage not logged" was kept. 
- With the new damage list and all other lists, a dictionary was created in which the dictionary keys are the names of the hurricanes and the values are dictionaries themselves     that contain a key for each data item (name, month, year, max persistent wind, affected areas, damage, death) over the hurricane. 
- Converted the current hurricane dictionary to a new dictionary, where the keys are years and the values are lists that contain a dictionary for each hurricane that occurred that   year. 
- Determined how often each area is listed as an area hit by a hurricane. 
- Calculated the area affected by the most hurricanes and how many times it was hit. 
- Finded the hurricane that caused the most deaths and how many it caused. 
- Conducted rate hurricanes on the mortality scale based on the ratings provided, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper limit of deaths with that rating. 
- Finded out how a hurricane caused the most damage and how expensive it was. 
- Conducted rate hurricanes on the damage scale according to the ratings given, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper damage limit for that rating.
